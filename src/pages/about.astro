						Hi, I'm Mike Collier â€“ an Enterprise AI Strategist at <a href="https://agile6.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Agile Six Applications</a> 
						where I help teams navigate the intersection of artificial intelligence, strategy, and human-centered design.
					</p>

					<p>
						With over 12 years in federal government contracting, I've had the privilege of working with teams at CMS, VA, CDC, and CEQ 
						to transform digital services and modernize critical government systems. My work focuses on bridging the gap between 
						cutting-edge AI capabilities and practical, ethical implementation in complex organizational environments.
					</p>

					<p>
						As an agile delivery expert, I guide cross-functional teams toward outcome-driven practices 
						that accelerate discovery-to-delivery flow. I'm particularly passionate about helping teams effectively integrate AI tools 
						into their workflows while maintaining responsible AI practices.
					</p>

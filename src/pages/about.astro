		Hi, I'm Mike Collier â€“ an Enterprise AI Strategist at <a href="https://agile6.com" target="_blank">Agile Six Applications</a> 
		where I help teams navigate the intersection of artificial intelligence, product strategy, and human-centered design.
	</p>

	<p>
		With over 12 years in federal government contracting, I've had the privilege of working with teams at CMS, VA, CDC, and CEQ 
		to transform digital services and modernize critical government systems. My work focuses on bridging the gap between 
		cutting-edge AI capabilities and practical, ethical implementation in complex organizational environments.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a product management coach and agile delivery expert, I guide cross-functional teams toward outcome-driven practices 
		that accelerate discovery-to-delivery flow. I'm particularly passionate about helping product managers, engineers, and 
		designers effectively integrate AI tools into their workflows while maintaining responsible AI practices.
	</p>

	<p>
		I hold an MBA from Rochester Institute of Technology and a BA from SUNY Oswego, along with certifications from 
		UC Berkeley's Product Management Studio and Lean Six Sigma Black Belt from Syracuse University.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I share insights on AI strategy implementation, product leadership in government environments, 
		and the evolving landscape of human-AI collaboration in product development. Whether you're an AI practitioner, 
		product manager, or government contractor exploring AI adoption, I hope you'll find valuable perspectives here.

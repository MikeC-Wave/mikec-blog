## A Difficult Season

It's been a tough few weeks. My 16 year old son tragically lost a friend at school. Still, small silver linings. He's become closer with other schoolmates as they go through this shared experience together.

I've been looking for opportunities to connect with him. Hoping to see a glimmer of inspiration. Hoping to see a spark of excitement for his future. He has been understandably irritable, and things have been tense. It has been stressful and difficult to navigate. I'm a Dad, a counselor-on-demand, an employee, a husband and an AI enthusiast, trying to balance all of the things.

## An Unexpected Opportunity

When I am hyper focused on something, it's hard for me to think about anything else. Despite that, I've been careful to not try to assert my own interests on my son. Yesterday was tough. Towards the end of the day, after a string of meetings, I became aware that Anthropic released new capabilities just a few hours earlier - their new Opus 4.5 model, and the introduction of Claude Code in the Claude desktop app. I read the benchmarks and watched the video of Claude Code on the desktop.

<CalloutBox type="note" title="A Realization">

The first words that came to my mind were *"inflection point."* A step towards bringing the powerful Claude Code out of the terminal and IDE and into an accessible environment, combined with a new model that excels in every area.

Maybe I was being selfish. A Dad distracted by work, looking for an excuse to share his obsession. Maybe I genuinely wanted to prepare him for a rapidly changing world. Probably both. I walked into the kitchen and asked if he wanted to learn how to create using AI. He seemed intimidated but interested.

He often comes into my office and watches my 3 screens flash with updates in the terminal. Code rapidly generated on the screen while I am feverishly typing - bouncing between 3 different applications or instances at any given time. To him, it seemed unapproachable.

I explained to him that the intimidating Integrated Development Environment was no longer a barrier to entry to use arguably the most powerful AI tool that exists today - Claude Code. "It became available in a desktop app today that will feel intuitive." He cautiously agreed to learn.

## Building Together

We sat down and I spent 20 minutes explaining file structures and attempted to impart some intuition on software architecture and how to think about systems in layers and how to think about modularity. We talked through some examples of building an app about bikes, and how we would model some foundational ideas about bikes in the "core" of the application, and would represent bike brands and their specific nuances in the "outer edges" of the application.

He got it, and drew apt parallels and analogies. Having primed him with the bike idea, I asked him what he wanted to build. He said he's really interested in cars - specifically McLarens, and thought it would be cool to build a McLaren fan website that aggregates information about McLaren models.

He became excited and impatient. But I told him that I needed to spend some time explaining multi-agent orchestration so he understood how we were going to write the prompt, and what he was about to watch agents do on the screen.

We had about 45 minutes before we needed to start a late dinner, so I rushed the prompt. Agents to research McLaren specifications, plan the tech stack, write the product requirements, and build it all in parallel, then an agent to validate and run the app locally. We agreed that the most important thing we wanted was the website to be **"visually stunning."**

We entered the prompt. I explained to him that I would usually spend an hour or more doing up-front planning and research, assisted by AI. This time, we were delegating all of it to the agents.

I told him that it would be incredible if we got a working website from a single prompt. I told him it might not look very good, but would serve as a good foundation for him to iterate on.

We watched as agents were deployed. Up to 6 at a time.

    <div class="stat-number">25</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Minutes</div>
  </div>
</StatsGrid>

I didn't know quite what to expect, but I saw the final agent finish and give me a URL to preview the app locally. I asked Jackson, "Are you ready?"

He nodded and I clicked the link.

## The Reveal

The site loaded. I scrolled. Our jaws dropped and I took my hand off the mouse. We stared at each other and our eyes watered, with our mouths remaining open.

It seems silly. A website about cars. But it was more than that. For me it was watching a spark of inspiration, and for him, hopefully it was excitement for his future. No matter what it was, it was a delightful moment, and one that I won't ever forget.

We did one more prompt after we downloaded google images of McLarens to replace the stock images that the agents had selected, instructing agents to use those images instead.

In two prompts and 25 minutes, we had a "visually stunning" website. My wife got home and my son couldn't even contain his excitement, wanting to show her his creation.

<CalloutBox type="success" title="His Words">

"I know what I want to do. I'm going to start a company. I know I can do it now. I'm not sure what it's going to be, but I'm going to be successful. It's possible for me to do this."

## A Spark Ignited

He spent the night researching products he wanted to bring to market. Luxury automotive car cleaning brands. Men's grooming products. He can't stop talking about it. He can't stop talking about how much he wants to create things, and how excited he is for his future as an entrepreneur.

*"Inflection point"* was right. Seeing a spark of excitement and glimmer of hope for the future is what I got, and that was a delightful moment.

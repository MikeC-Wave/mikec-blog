## From Manual Workarounds to Seamless Integration

Four months ago, when Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding," I was cutting my teeth with Replit and Cursor, creating applications for both personal and professional use. I started dozens of projects, mostly unfinished, but each one taught me something valuable about the limitations of working with isolated AI tools.

The term "vibe coding" didn't capture what I was doing. I wasn't just prompting AI and hoping for the best. I wasn't writing a single line of code myself (I didn't know how to) but I was attempting to apply software development best practices to create reliable, extensible, and maintainable code. The challenge? Each tool lived in its own silo.

## The Context Sharing Problem

I spent hundreds of hours using coding agents to create applications and refactor them until they became easy to change. But I constantly hit barriers. Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the defacto coding model that coding agents leveraged, but it was not as nearly as powerful as models are today. More powerful models existed, but their availability was trapped in bespoke platforms like ChatGPT. Sharing context between different AI models and orchestrating development required creative workarounds.

I became proficient at manually chaining different AI tools together, leveraging each one for its strengths:
- **Replit Agent**: Kicked off projects and created working MVPs  
- **Cursor Agent**: Helped refactor code and implement features
- **OpenAI o1/o1 Pro**: Reviewed code and made architectural recommendations

What I learned: the models and tools *collectively* had powerful capabilities when chained together, but each tool alone was not sufficient to eliminate the need for manual coding entirely. Someone with software engineering experience could troubleshoot issues by digging into the code. My lack of coding experience sent me on a relentless pursuit to find better ways to share context between agents.

## Enter the Model Context Protocol

About two months ago, I started to learn how to chain tools, models, and agents together using the Model Context Protocol. MCP isn't just another tool - it supports a fundamental shift in how AI agents can work together, enabling seamless context transfer.

## Building This Blog: A Case Study in Orchestrated Intelligence

To demonstrate the power of MCP-enabled orchestration, I'm going to share how I set up this blog site in about 3 hours:

### Setting Up the Integration

I used Claude.ai to brainstorm the technology stack and examine tradeoffs. I landed on an Astro blog with Tailwind CSS hosted on Cloudflare Workers. I had Claude create a Linear issue for me that would reflect those decisions and provide context to the Cursor coding agent.

The first step was connecting Linear to Claude through MCP. This involved configuring the Linear MCP server in my Claude web application, which takes just a few seconds but unlocked powerful capabilities:

  title="Setting Up Linear MCP Integration"
/>

### Creating the Project Requirements

With the Linear MCP server connected, Claude could now directly access my Linear workspace, read existing issues, create new ones, and maintain full context about my management workflow. This eliminated the typical friction of manually copying requirements between tools.

Once the integration was set up, I could ask Claude to create a Linear issue for the blog MVP. Watch how seamlessly Claude accesses Linear, understands my workspace structure, and creates a detailed issue with acceptance criteria and technical specifications:

<SimpleVideo 
  src="https://blog-assets.mikec.ai/claude-issue-creation.mp4"
  title="Creating Linear Issue in Claude.ai"
/>

This demonstrates the power of MCP in action: instead of manually switching between Claude and Cursor, copying and pasting requirements, and losing context in translation, the entire workflow happens in one place with full context preservation. Claude created not just a simple task, but a comprehensive technical specification that any developer (or AI agent) could implement with complete understanding.

### Implementation and Iteration

With the Linear issue created, I moved to Cursor to begin implementation. I simply referenced the Linear issue number and asked Cursor to create an implementation plan.

Watch how Cursor seamlessly accesses the Linear issue via MCP, reads the full context, and creates a comprehensive implementation plan:

<SimpleVideo 
  src="https://blog-assets.mikec.ai/mcp-blog-cursor-plan-creation.mp4"
  title="Cursor Creating Implementation Plan from Linear Issue"
/>

This demonstrates the seamless handoff between AI agents. Cursor didn't just read the issue title - it understood the full context, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria that Claude had documented. The agent then created a detailed implementation plan and documented it as a comment in the Linear issue, maintaining the complete audit trail of the development process.

From there, Cursor leveraged the Cloudflare documentation MCP server to understand the latest deployment approaches, and implemented each phase with proper git commits.

### Quality Assurance Through Automated Review

The iterative refinement process involved bouncing between claude.ai, Cursor, and GitHub. Claude.ai examined existing code via the Claude Github integration and provided architectural guidance and created new Linear issues. Cursor accessed the Linear issues and implemented the recommended changes. 

To ensure code quality throughout this rapid development cycle, I configured [Cursor's BugBot](https://docs.cursor.com/bugbot) to automatically review every pull request. This created an additional layer of orchestrated intelligence - while I focused on feature development, BugBot handled quality assurance, automatically analyzing code diffs and flagging bugs before they reached the main branch. This integration of automated code review into the MCP workflow mitigated the quality vs. speed tradeoff in rapid prototyping.

## Why MCP Changes Everything

MCP enables orchestration where specialized AI tools work together seamlessly, enabling us to efficiently leverage their respective strengths without losing context.

The Model Context Protocol eliminates the fundamental barriers that prevented effective AI tool orchestration:

- **Elimination of Context Barriers**: No more copy-pasting codebases or re-explaining requirements
- **Seamless Tool Integration**: Agents can access shared context from any connected tool  
- **Intelligent Handoffs**: Work flows naturally between specialized agents and tools
- **Persistent Understanding**: Context persists across tool switches and sessions

## The Future is Orchestrated Intelligence

We're moving beyond "vibe coding" to something far more powerful: orchestrated AI development where context flows seamlessly between specialized tools, and each agent contributes its unique capabilities to a unified workflow.

MCP represents a fundamental shift from isolated AI tools to interconnected networks. When agents can share context seamlessly, the collective capability exceeds what any single tool could achieve.

No more copy-pasting entire codebases between tools. No more explaining the same requirements multiple times.

## Getting Started with MCP Orchestration

If you're ready to move beyond manual tool switching and experience the power of orchestrated AI development, here's how to begin:

1. **Enable MCP servers** that connect your planning, implementation, and review tools
2. **Leverage Tool Strengths**: Let each agent focus on what it does best while sharing context
3. **Build Custom Servers**: As you identify repetitive context-sharing needs, find new MCP servers or build MCP servers

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol has transformed my approach to building software by enabling seamless orchestration of AI tools. It's not about replacing human developers or "vibing" our way to working code. It's about creating intelligent workflows where specialized AI agents contribute their unique strengths through seamless integration.

MCP eliminates the friction that made multi-tool AI development frustrating and unreliable. When context flows between agents, and each tool can focus on its strengths while maintaining full understanding of the project, the result is a development environment that feels like magic.

The blog you're reading exists because of this orchestrated intelligence.
